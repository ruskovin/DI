        <h3>1. WHAT IS CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML defines the structure of a web page. CSS describes how
            elements are displayed on the screen. HTML represents content, and CSS represents the appearance of the
            content.

        <h3>2. CSS SYNTAX</h3>
        <p>
            A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and some declarations.

            The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. It can be a html tag, class or id.

            Declarations are defined in a declaration block, surrounded by curly brackets {}, each declaration includes
            a CSS property name and value in this format name: value, and ends with a semicolon ;.

            You can also add comments, surrounded by /* and */.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Selectors</h3>
        <p>
            CSS selectors are used to “find” (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

            We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
        <ul>
            <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
            <li>Combinator selectors : Select elements based on a specific relationship between them</li>
            <li>Pseudo-class selectors : Select elements based on a certain state</li>
            <li>Pseudo-elements selectors : Select and style a part of an element</li>
            <li>Attribute selectors: Select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>
        </ul>
